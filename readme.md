This repository aims at outlining a good schedule to make yourself familiar with Data Structures and Algorithms. I have begun with basic Data structures like, linked list, Arrays, Trees. 

I have not shown the implementation of of Stacks, Queues explicitely but they are being used here and there for your reference. One reason for not using queues explicitely is the application of list data structure provided in python which does the job for most purposes.

Before you go on to reading the code. I would highly recommend reading these articles orderwise.
